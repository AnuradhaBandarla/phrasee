# QA Automated Tests for V8 
Mocha - An automated test framework powered by [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have SSH keys set up on your environment + Github account ([guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)). We recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for developing tests as it provides a fully integrated environment. This README assumes you are using VSCode.
